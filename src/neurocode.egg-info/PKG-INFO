# NeuroCode

NeuroCode is an engine for structural understanding and modification of codebases, built around a Neural Intermediate Representation (Neural IR). It is **infrastructure for AI applied to code**, not an IDE, assistant, or AI terminal.

The goal is to let AI models reason about a codebase like a senior engineer with a global view of structure, dependencies, and behavior — not like a text-only LLM reading files in isolation.

## Vision

Traditional LLM-based coding tools:

- read code as plain text, not as structured programs
- lose global context across large repositories
- do not truly understand dependency graphs
- often produce fragile, local patches
- struggle with multi-file refactors
- cannot reliably find complex bugs involving control/data flow or cross-module effects

NeuroCode introduces a **neural IR layer for code** that:

- represents the codebase as rich program structure
- is optimized for AI reasoning
- enables globally coherent patches and refactors

## Core Concepts

NeuroCode builds and operates on a stack of representations:

- **AST per file** – syntactic structure of each source file
- **Call graph** – functions/methods and their invocation relationships
- **Module dependency graph** – imports and higher-level coupling
- **Control-flow graph (CFG)** – possible execution paths
- **Data-flow** – value propagation and usage
- **Neural IR** – a compressed, structured representation suitable as input to LLMs and other models

On top of this IR, NeuroCode will support:

- detection of complex, non-local bugs
- generation of globally coherent patches
- real refactoring (including multi-file refactors in later versions)
- API upgrades and internal interface evolution
- intelligent test generation

## Non-Goals

- NeuroCode is **not** a GUI-first tool.
- NeuroCode is **not** a general-purpose chatbot.
- NeuroCode is **not** tied to a single LLM provider or model.

Instead, it aims to be **the infrastructure layer** that other agents, IDEs, and tools can build on to gain deep, structural understanding of code.
